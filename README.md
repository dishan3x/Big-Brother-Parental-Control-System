# Bigbrother Parental Control System

Scope: Implement two-way communication between two STM32F407VG Discovery Boards
via a Raspberry Pi that hosted a MQTT server.

Goals:
1. Create a functioning circular buffer by implementing CircularBuffer.c and
CircularBuffer.h files.
2. Implement successfully the circular buffer code using the provided main code file
3. Use the provided JSON libraries to implement communication between the
STM32F407VG Discovery Board and the MQTT server hosted on the Raspberry Pi.
4. Configure GPIO pins on the STM32F407VG Discovery Board.
